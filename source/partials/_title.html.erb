      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>Iâ€™ve started my developer journey in Sep. 2020, joining LeWagon part-time bootcamp in Tokyo.
        After 24 weeks I graduated in March 2021 as a certified Fullstack Web Developer.
        I have worked as a Recruitment Consultant in Tokyo for nearly three years.
        As such, communication, organization, and efficiency have always been key.
        Being a coder allows me the freedom to experience all of those in a new way.</p>
